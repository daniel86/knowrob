% Cut. Discard all choice points created since entering the predicate in which
% the cut appears. In other words, commit to the clause in which the cut appears
% and discard choice points that have been created by goals to the left of the cut
% in the current clause. Meta calling is opaque to the cut. This implies that cuts that
% appear in a term that is subject to meta-calling (call/1) only affect choice points
% created by the meta-called term.
%
% To realize cut, every clause [X0,...,Xn,!|_] is rewritten as [limit(1, [X0,....,Xn])|_]
% NOTE: the rewriting is currently a special case in compiler.pl and cannot be handled
%         through existing interfaces for commands in this file.
% NOTE: but disjunction below handles cut in disjunction goals
